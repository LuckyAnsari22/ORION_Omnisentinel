## 🎯 JUDGE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### "Why did you build this?"
> "36 million elderly falls occur annually. The real danger isn't the fall—it's the 'Long Lie,' where victims wait hours for help. We built OmniSentinel to eliminate that delay using Google's AI technologies."

### "How does it work?"
> "We use TensorFlow MoveNet for 60 FPS skeletal tracking to detect falls instantly. When detected, Firebase Cloud Messaging sends alerts in under 45 seconds. For visual intelligence, we leverage Gemini Pro Vision to help visually impaired users navigate safely."

### "What makes it different?"
> "Three things: First, our 3D orchestration layer makes AI interaction feel magical, not intimidating. Second, we unify fall detection and visual intelligence in one platform. Third, we use edge-based TensorFlow processing for privacy—no video leaves the device."

### "Can it scale?"
> "Absolutely. We're using Firebase for auto-scaling, Cloud Functions for serverless processing, and a microservices architecture. At 1,000 users, estimated cost is $50/month. At 10,000 users, Cloud Run auto-scales seamlessly."

### "What about privacy?"
> "Privacy-first design. TensorFlow Lite runs on-device, so video analysis happens locally. Only metadata and alerts go to the cloud. We're HIPAA-ready and GDPR-compliant."

### "Why Google technologies?"
> "Google has the best-in-class AI/ML tools. TensorFlow for pose estimation, Gemini for multimodal understanding, Firebase for real-time infrastructure. They work together seamlessly and scale infinitely."

### "Is this just a demo or production-ready?"
> "Production-ready architecture. We have a working MVP with 15,000+ lines of code, comprehensive documentation, and a clear scaling strategy. We're ready to deploy to nursing homes today."

### "What's next?"
> "Phase 2: Predictive AI using Cloud AI Platform to detect falls before they happen. Phase 3: ARCore integration for spatial guidance. Phase 4: Enterprise deployment to 500+ nursing homes."
